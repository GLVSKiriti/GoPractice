First do "tsc --init" command which produces tsconfig.json
npm init -y (initoalizing a node project)

There will be 2 folders generally one is src(source folder) and dist(distribution folder)
src folder is like where you write all the source code
dist folder is like the cod ewhich is served in production

Now in dist folder automaticaly js files are produced when you run ts files in src
so to do that go to tsconfig.json
and uncomment the line outDir and mention the output directory

//here Even you run command "tsc index.ts" it wont produce js file in dist folders it produces in same folder
 but if you run in watch mode it produces "tsc -w"
